# What I did:
- (1/5/24) Participated into competitions several times; found that got excited at first, but lost motivation days after
- Realzied that I need a consistent long term plan to achive this goal, or anything complicated actually. Ask different LLMs (Claude, CHatGPT, Bard, Bing...) to come up wtih the specific 2-month plan to become a kaggle competition master. 
- Find some partners who are interested in DS and Kaggle through the kaggle discord server.
