# What I did:
- (1/6/24): Started the google data advanced data analytics course, and probably would be good to record some template that is good for traditinoal machine learning/deep learning, or some other common utility functions that can be useful for reproduction 
- (1/5/24) Participated into competitions several times; found that got excited at first, but lost motivation days after
- Realzied that I need a consistent long term plan to achive this goal, or anything complicated actually. Ask different LLMs (Claude, CHatGPT, Bard, Bing...) to come up wtih the specific 2-month plan to become a kaggle competition master. 
- Find some partners who are interested in DS and Kaggle through the kaggle discord server.
